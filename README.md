# Paddock-2d

Python3 & Pygame2 port of Buntine's Swervin Mervin game

### Playing

Ensure that you have [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/) and [Pygame 2.x](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml) installed, and then:

```
  $ ./play
```

Accelleration and steering is performed via the arrow keys. [ENTER] to start, [ESC] to kill the game in fullscreen mode.

Many in-game settings can be changed in `./swervin_mervin/settings.py` but I'll also load in settings that are defined in `./swervin_mervin/settings_local.py` (which is gitignored).
